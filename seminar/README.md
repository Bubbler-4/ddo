# DDO-Seminar

This sub repository contains the docker image and notebook that have designed in support of the 
"Elevate Your Problem-Solving Skills with Dynamic Programming: A Theoretical and Hands-On Seminar" 
at UCLouvain on Dec. 7th, 2023. 

The image has been pre-built and uploaded onto docker hub so as to lower the barrier to entry for
all participants. All what they have to do is to run the following command:
 
```
docker run -p 8888:8888 xgillard:ddo-seminar
```

And then open their browser at the following location: http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/ddo_seminar.ipynb

That's it.
