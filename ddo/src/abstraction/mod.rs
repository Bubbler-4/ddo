//! This module (and its submodule) provide the abstractions for the basic
//! building blocks of an MDD solvers. A client willing to use our library to
//! implement a solver for his/her particular problem should look into the `dp`
//! submodule. Indeed, `dp` is the place where the traits `Problem` and
//! `Relaxation` are defined. These are the two abstractions that one *must*
//! implement in order to be able to use our library.
